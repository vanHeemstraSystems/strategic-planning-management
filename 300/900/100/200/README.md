# 200 - Strategic Seeing: Mastering the Art of Problem-Solving for Growth

This study guide explores the "Strategic Seeing" framework, which shifts business focus from arbitrary goal-setting to the identification and resolution of "Big Customer Problems." By analyzing historical precedents and modern business successes, the source provides a blueprint for creating a strategy centered on underlying human needs rather than market tropes.

Study Quiz: Short-Answer Questions

1. According to the text, what is the primary risk of setting ambitious "strategic goals" at the start of a project? Setting ambitious goals often results in "winning aspirations" that are disconnected from reality. The author notes that a mistake in the very first step of strategy is often fatal because if the wrong direction is chosen, every subsequent step drives the company further away from its mission.

2. Explain the metaphor of "reading the label from inside the bottle" as it relates to business strategy. This metaphor describes the mistake of trying to build a strategy or a customer portrait while staring at one's own reflection or internal processes. To find the right direction, a business must look from the outside in, focusing on external customer struggles rather than internal desires for growth or leadership.

3. Why does the author argue against starting a strategy by selecting a "market"? Selecting a market assumes that options are already predefined and forces a company to play by someone else’s rules in established territory. Furthermore, "empty niches" are often misleading because there may be a gap in the market, but no actual market exists within that gap.

4. How does the text define a "Big Customer Problem"? A Big Customer Problem, or an Underlying Need, is a struggle, friction point, or obstacle that a customer accepts as an unavoidable fact of life. These problems are often invisible to the customer until a solution is provided, yet they constantly drain the customer's time, energy, sanity, or money.

5. What is the difference between strategy and scaling as described in the source? Strategy involves identifying a Big Customer Problem and building a unique value proposition to solve it. In contrast, simply hunting for new customers for an existing product is considered scaling sales, not a strategic endeavor.

6. What was the true strategic lesson of Samuel Brannan’s "shovels and gold" story? The lesson is not merely about selling tools during a craze, but about identifying a Big Customer Problem before others notice it. Brannan realized that the influx of people would create a massive, immediate need for tools, allowing him to create his own market and dictate terms.

7. How should a company determine the eventual scale of its business? The scale of a business is not determined by the personal ambition of its leaders or "10X" growth targets. Instead, the scale is dictated by the magnitude and importance of the specific customer problem the business chooses to solve.

8. What role do "foresight games" and customer interviews play in this framework? These tools are used during the intensive research phase—sometimes lasting months—to identify the Big Customer Problem. They help the team go "deep in the trenches" to dissect workflows and find friction points that customers have subconsciously accepted as unchangeable facts of life.

9. How does a "Big Customer Problem" translate into a "Customer Need"? The Big Customer Problem is the raw struggle identified in the market, while the Customer Need is that problem translated into business language. For example, if the problem is airport queues, the Need is the desire to "reclaim hours wasted standing on a terminal floor."

10. What is the significance of the term "Patron" in the context of this strategy? A Patron is more than just a customer; they are the specific individuals whose needs dictate the entire strategic playbook. The purpose of a business is to create and keep a Patron by walking in their shoes and solving their unique struggles.

Answer Key

1. Fatal first steps: A mistake in direction at the start is fatal; it leads the company away from its mission regardless of how many steps are taken.
2. External perspective: Companies must stop looking at their own reflections and instead observe the customer's reality from an external viewpoint to identify genuine needs.
3. Predefined territory: Markets often mean playing by others' rules; "gaps" in markets are often empty of actual customers or demand.
4. Accepted friction: It is a struggle or task that drains resources (time/money) which the customer has mistakenly accepted as a "fact of life."
5. Creation vs. Expansion: Strategy is about problem-solving and rewriting the context, whereas scaling is merely increasing the volume of current sales.
6. Spotting the problem early: Brannan identified the "shovels" problem before it became a global craze, allowing him to manipulate the market effectively.
7. Problem magnitude: The scale depends entirely on the scale of the problem solved; solving bigger problems leads to bigger business.
8. Identifying invisible pain: They are used to uncover problems that customers don't even recognize as problems yet, such as the need for cloud storage over flash drives.
9. Business translation: The Need acts as the strategic axis, turning a friction point (the problem) into a targetable objective (the need).
10. Strategic focus: Patrons define the "who" of the strategy; the business exists to solve problems specifically for them, ensuring long-term loyalty.

Essay Research Prompts

1. The Ethics and Strategy of Market Manipulation: Using the example of Samuel Brannan, analyze the distinction between "questionable tactics" and "spot-on strategic direction." Does the author suggest that Brannan's success was due to his ethics or his ability to see a problem before others?
2. The "No Strategy" Approach to Market Creation: Critique the author's assertion that ordinary companies "write themselves into the context" while the best ones "rewrite it." How does focusing on a Big Customer Problem allow a company to create its own market rules?
3. The Diagnostic Phase of Strategy: The author mentions spending three months identifying a single problem for a client. Discuss the potential risks and rewards of this long-term diagnostic approach compared to the traditional, fast-paced "set a goal and follow it" method.
4. Technological Obsolescence and Customer Friction: Using the examples of Dropbox and Wise, explain how identifying "accepted friction" leads to the disruption of established industries. Why do customers often fail to recognize these problems until a solution exists?
5. The Five Pillars as a Framework for Alignment: Evaluate the Five Pillars of Strategy. How does the alignment of these five elements (Problem, Need, Patron, Market, Value) prevent a strategy from becoming a "shopping list you didn't write"?
