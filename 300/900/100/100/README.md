# Strategic Seeing: Solving the Big Customer Problem

Executive Summary

The core of successful business strategy lies not in setting ambitious growth goals or entering pre-existing markets, but in "Strategic Seeing"—the ability to identify and solve a Big Customer Problem. Traditional strategic planning often fails because it is inward-looking, focusing on "winning aspirations" rather than the underlying needs of the customer. By shifting focus from "where to play" to identifying friction points that customers currently accept as "facts of life," a company can rewrite the market context rather than simply reacting to it. A robust strategy is built upon five essential pillars: the Big Customer Problem, the Customer Need, Target Customers (Patrons), Target Markets, and Unique Customer Value.

The Fallacy of Conventional Strategic Planning

Modern business strategy is often hampered by overcomplication or misplaced simplicity. Many organizations fall into the trap of "reading the label from inside the bottle," focusing on internal desires rather than external realities.

The Problem with "Winning Aspirations"

Most strategic slide decks prioritize "winning aspirations" such as becoming a market leader or achieving 10X growth. The text characterizes these as "primitive and useless," equating them to painting a portrait while looking in a mirror. These goals are often disconnected from the actual value provided to the customer.

Fatal Errors in Initial Steps

In strategy, a mistake in the first step is often fatal. Two common but dangerous starting points include:

* Market Selection: Choosing a market based on "empty niches" assumes options are pre-written. This approach often leads companies to play by someone else’s rules in a territory that may not actually contain a viable market.
* Customer-First Identification: Attempting to identify "who is the customer" before understanding the problem or product is counterproductive. If a product exists, this is merely scaling; if it does not, the future client base remains unknown.

The Historical Precedent: Beyond the "Shovel" Cliché

The story of Samuel Brannan during the 1848 California Gold Rush provides a foundational lesson in strategic direction. While Brannan is often cited for the cliché of "selling shovels during a gold rush," his true strategic insight was identifying a Big Customer Problem before the rush even materialized.

* Anticipation of Need: Brannan secured the supply of tools (shovels, pickaxes) before the mass influx of miners arrived.
* Market Manipulation vs. Strategic Direction: While his ethics were questionable (buying all local tools to inflate prices), his strategic direction was "spot on" because he identified a bottleneck problem that every miner would inevitably face.
* The Limitation of Following the Rush: Simply looking for a "gold rush" to join means playing by existing rules. True success comes from identifying the problem that others are too busy to notice.

Defining the "Big Customer Problem"

The bedrock of a successful strategy is the Big Customer Problem (or Underlying Need). This is not a simple desire for a product, but a fundamental friction point in the customer's life.

Characteristics of a Big Customer Problem

* A "Fact of Life": Customers often do not recognize these issues as problems; they simply accept them as inevitable chores or obstacles.
* Resource Drain: These problems drain the customer’s time, energy, sanity, or money.
* Foundation for Scale: The scale of a business is determined by the scale of the problem it solves, not the ambition of its leaders.

Illustrative Examples of Solved Problems

Company	Big Customer Problem Solved
Dropbox	The physical chore of saving files to and carrying flash drives.
Wise	The high cost and "pain" associated with international money transfers.
Stripe	The friction and complexity of accepting payments for websites.
Fitted Sheets	The struggle of securing flat bedding to a mattress.

The Five Pillars of Strategy

The Big Customer Problem must be translated into business language to form the strategic axis. This axis dictates the entire corporate playbook through five interconnected pillars.

1. Big Customer Problem: The identified friction point or "fact of life" causing customer struggle.
2. Customer Need: The Big Customer Problem translated into a business objective (e.g., if the problem is airport queues, the need is "to reclaim hours wasted").
3. Target Customers (Patrons): The specific group of people who experience this problem.
4. Target Markets: The environments where these customers and problems are found.
5. Unique Customer Value (UCV): The specific solution or value proposition built to resolve the identified problem.

Diagnostic for Leadership: The CEO’s Uncomfortable Questions

To determine if a strategy is focused on the correct "Strategic Seeing" or merely acting as a "shopping list" written by someone else, leadership must address four critical questions:

* Current Problem: Do you know which Big Customer Problem your business is solving today?
* Future Problem: Do you know which Big Customer Problem your business will be solving tomorrow?
* Executive Priority: If you asked your top executives which customer needs are the priority, could they all give an answer?
* Internal Alignment: Even if they could answer, would their answers be identical?

Strategy should not be about following a pre-set path; it is about choosing a direction based on an underlying need that the rest of the market is ignoring. Finding this direction requires "walking in the customers' shoes" and potentially spending months identifying the problem before even attempting to craft a solution.
