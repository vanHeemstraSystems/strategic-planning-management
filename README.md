**Executive Summary**

Strategic planning (6 years timespan) is the lead for [tactical planning](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/tactical-planning-management) (6 quarters timespan).

Strategic planning makes use of [Objectives and Key Results](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/objectives-and-key-results).

Andy Grove, CEO at Intel, first spoke about “Objectives and Key Results” (OKR) in his book High Output Management.

"A successful system needs only to answer two questions: Where do I want to go? The answer provides the Objective. How will I pace myself to see if I’m getting there? The answer gives us Key Results."

“The one thing OKR provides par excellence is focus.”

“We see a nesting hierarchy of Objectives: if the subordinate’s Objectives are met, the supervisor’s Objectives will be met as well.”

“To be useful a Key Result must contain very specific wording and dates, so that when the deadline time arrives, there is no room for ambiguity.”
